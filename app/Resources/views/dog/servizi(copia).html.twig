                      <p>
                        The grooming service includes care and maintenance of the sanitary area as well as the cleaning of the paws to prevent any infections and knots for a good locomotion.
                        Each instrument used is sterilized at each step.
                        For the bath, the water is adjusted to 38 Â° C, the ideal temperature for the dog.
                        Each breed has its own appropriate shampoo.
